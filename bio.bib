  abstract = {Several recently published papers in Decision Support Systems discussed issues related to data quality in Information Systems research. In this short research note, I build on the work introduced in these papers and document two data quality issues discovered in a large open dataset commonly used in research. Inside Airbnb (IA) collects data from places and reviews as posted by users of Airbnb.com. Visitors can effortlessly download data collected by IA for several locations around the globe. While the dataset is widely used in academic research, no thorough investigation of the dataset and its validity has been conducted. This note examines the dataset and explains an issue of incorrect data added to the dataset. Findings suggest that this issue can be attributed to systemic errors in the data collection process. The results suggest that the use of unverified open datasets can be problematic, although the discoveries presented in this work may not be significant enough to challenge all published research that used the IA dataset. Additionally, findings indicate that the incorrect data happens because of a new feature implemented by Airbnb. Thus, unless changes are made, it is likely that the consequences of this issue will only become more severe. Finally, this note explores why reproducibility is a problem when two different releases of the dataset are compared.},

  abstract = {Millions of tourists have used Airbnb accommodations, and Airbnb is frequently discussed in terms of its current or future impacts on hotels. The purpose of this research was to investigate such impacts by determining the extent to which Airbnb is used as a hotel substitute and to examine how Airbnb guests expect their accommodations to perform relative to hotels. Together, these analyses were intended to provide empirical insight into Airbnb's status as a disruptive innovation. The study involved an online survey of over 800 tourists who had used Airbnb within the previous year. Nearly two-thirds had used Airbnb as a hotel substitute. When considering traditional hotel attributes (e.g., cleanliness and comfort), Airbnb was generally expected to outperform budget hotels/motels, underperform upscale hotels, and have mixed outcomes versus mid-range hotels, signalling some -- but not complete -- consistency with the concept of disruptive innovation. Numerous practical and theoretical implications are discussed.},
